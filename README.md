# SelectiveUnblur BetterDiscord Plugin

A BetterDiscord plugin that unblurs certain channels of your choosing. This is intended to unblur images, videos, and also unhide spoiler text.

**This plugin requires Zere's Plugin Library AND the XenoLib library**

_Credit to whoever made MessageLoggerV2 as I based my code (and understanding of BetterDiscord) off of it_

## Instructions

To install the code, click "raw" on GitHub and then click "save as" and save the JavaScript file. Drag the file into your plugins folder.

Next, make sure you turn on the plugin! The plugin doesn't do anything on its own. Access the plugin's settings panel over in plugins and then click the gear icon. There will be a text box that allows you to type text.

Type all channels that you want in the textbox, seperated by a comma ONLY (no spaces)

### Example

chat-for-friends,show-your-pets,anime-spoilers
